# TOS-and-Thinkscript-Snippet-Collection

The "TOS and Thinkscript Snippet Collection" by [StanL]( http://mytrade.com/StanL) has been a great help in my thinkscript development journey.  I constantly look to this work for ideas and techniques.

It appears that "TOS and Thinkscript Snippet Collection" hasn't been update in 3 years as of this writing, ...  I am not sure is something happened to StanL or what.

My Motivations:  I found the pdf hard to read at times and I want the great work StanL did to live on. Converted the Markdown version to AsciiDoctor and generate with Gradle AsciDoctor Plugin.
