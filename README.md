# TOS-and-Thinkscript-Snippet-Collection

The "TOS and Thinkscript Snippet Collection" by [StanL]( http://mytrade.com/StanL) has been a great help in my thinkscript development journey.  I constantly look to this work for ideas and techniques.

It appears that "TOS and Thinkscript Snippet Collection" hasn't been update in 3 years as of this writing, ...  I am not sure is something happened to StanL or what.

My Motivations:  I found the pdf hard to read at times and I want the great work StanL did to live on.  So I converted the PDF to Markdown format.  [TOS-and-Thinkscript-Snippet-Collection](https://github.com/jshingler/TOS-and-Thinkscript-Snippet-Collection/blob/master/TOS%20%26%20ThinkScript%20Snippet%20Collection.md).

As converting from PDF to Markdown is a lot of work, ... This is a work in process and I will continue to work on the formatting and clean up.

Please feel free to fork and send me pull requests or corrections and additions.
