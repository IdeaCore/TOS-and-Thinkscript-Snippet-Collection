=== WLC-PRICE-TO-EARNINGS (P/E) RATIO FOR A WATCHLIST COLUMN



```
#hint:For a WatchList Column (WLC), shows the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. In trader's jargon this tells how expensive a stock's earnings are. Discussions and the literature often relate this to the over-all-market P/E average.

rec AE = if IsNaN(GetActualEarnings()) then 0 else GetActualEarnings();
def EPS_TTM = Sum(AE, 252);#The sum of the trailing twelve months EPS
def PE = close/EPS_TTM ;#The P/E ratio

AddLabel(yes,  round(PE,1));
#end
```


=== WLC-WHEN A DIVERGENCE EXISTS BETWEEN PRICE AND THE MACD



```
#hint:Looks for and indicates positive (price rising) and negative (price declining) divergences of price and the MACD
Input Bars = 3;#Hint Bars:The number of bars in the pattern to evaluate

def mcdv = MACD();
def MACD_rising = sum(mcdv > mcdv[1],bars) == bars;#True if MACD is rising for the last number-of-bars (Bars)
def price_rising = sum(close > close[1],bars) == bars;#True if close is rising for the last number-of-bars (Bars)
def MACD_falling = sum(mcdv < mcdv[1],bars) == bars;#True if MACD is falling for the last number-of-bars (Bars)
def price_falling = sum(close < close[1],bars) == bars;#True if close is falling for the last number-of-bars (Bars)
def pos_div = price_rising && MACD_falling;
def neg_div =  price_falling && MACD_rising;

AddLabel(1, if pos_div  then "pos" else if neg_div then "neg" else "none",  if pos_div == 1 then color.green else if neg_div == 1 then color.red else color.pink );

AssignBackgroundColor(if pos_div then color.dark_green
  else if neg_div then
  color.dark_RED
  else color.current);#Divergence with MACD rising & price falling is RED. The opposite is GREEN. Neither is the normal
  color.

#=====to prove out the code or to use this as a study, plot the below
#   and evaluate that the conditions and results are correct ========
plot Positive = pos_div;# A CYAN value of 'one' plots where true exists
Plot Negative = neg_div;# A PINK value of 'one' plots where true exists

=== WLC OF BARS-INTO-A-SQUEEZE



```
#hint;A WatchList Column (WLC) that shows whether an equity is in a squeeze and if so how many bars it has been in a squeeze. Be sure to set the agg to the chart agg you want to view this on. This is very efficient code.

def Squeeze = if (BollingerBandsSMA()."UpperBand" - KeltnerChannels()."Upper_Band") < 0 then 1 else 0;
def count = compoundvalue(1, If squeeze then count[1] + 1 else if !squeeze then 0 else 0,1);

#addlabel(1, "Bars into a squeeze = " + count, If squeeze then Color.LIGHT_RED else color.Current);
#if column width is a concern the label below shortens the word length and shows the count value

addlabel(1, "SQZ= " + count, If squeeze then Color.LIGHT_RED else color.Current);
# end
```
